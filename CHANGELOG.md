## 1.0.2
### What's Changed
Added selected values and uppercase text selection
#### Breaking changes
With the current implementation of uppercase selection text. This changes might affect the use of selected values, the dropdown will select nothing because the text is different from the updated one. Even though this effect can be eliminate from our side, we decided to fix it on the next release.

## 1.0.1

- Display region, province, city/municipality dropdown
- Dependent display of list based on selection
- Return string value of the selected item
